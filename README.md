cleanc14 was an experiment package providing some utility functions for cleaning radiocarbon data in R. These have now been incorporated into [c14](https://github.com/joeroe/c14).

The dataset `c14_material_thesaurus` was originally compiled by Clemens Schmid, David Matzig, Dirk Seidensticker, Joe Roe, and Thomas Huet, for the package [c14bazAAR](https://docs.ropensci.org/c14bazAAR/).
